# Module13-EComBackend

## Description
          
This program is an API or back-end for a E-commerce site. It demonstrates how a database can be manipulated to retrieve data, for one product, tag and category, or multiple products, tags and categories. Often business's need their databases to be flexible so they can add, update and delete new products, necessary tags and categories, and this is possible due to specific routes that retrieve specific data and allow it to be modified.
